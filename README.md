## Gender & HDI Project
### 1. Introduction and scope
The Human Development Index(HDI) is a summary of measures of average achievement in key dimensions of human development, notably: health, education, and standard of living.
The Sustainable Development Goal(SDG) has prioritized gender equality and empowerment of women in its goal five. Similarly, it has also focused on inclusive and equitable quality education with lifelong learning opportunities for all. So, considering the importance of gender and educational attainment, I have attempted to compare the years of schooling of the female with the HDI according to the country's ranking status. So, the major questions to answer are:
1. Is there any relation between HDI and years of schooling of females.
2. Are there any differences between the HDI of males and the HDI of females.
### 2. The data :chart:
For this research, I have collected data from UNdata: http://data.un.org/DocumentData.aspx?id=417 and contains the HDI value, years of schooling indicators, percapita income, and other additional information of 166 countries. The data I have used is of the year 2018.  The data have 166 rows and 15 columns. Each row provides information on each country's HDI, GDI, years of schooling, and per capita income with respect to males and females.
### 3. Methods used :bar_chart:
The main features included in the data analysis are HDI rank, HDI of males and females, and years of schooling of females. For two broad questions, I have implemented one-way ANOVA and t-test.
### 4. Results and Recommendation :clipboard:
The result showed that there is a significant difference in HDI and female's years of education. Similarly, male's and female's HDI showed significant differences meaning gender disparity exists in human development.
